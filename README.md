# Forge Design Automation - WebSocket API Samples

Please reference [Forge Design Automation documentation](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/overview/) while using these samples. You may find the [section on the WebSocket API](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/design-automation/v3/developers_guide/websocket-api/) particularly useful.

There are 2 samples:

1. An app that uses the websocket api from the [browser](./browser).
2. An app that uses the websocket api from C# [console app](./console).

Additionally, the [service](./service) folder contains common setup code.
